/*  TIME SERVER (Exercise 10 of 13)  
   
  Write a TCP time server!  
   
  Your server should listen to TCP connections on the port provided by the  
  first argument to your program. For each connection you must write the  
  current date & 24 hour time in the format:  
   
     "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm"  
   
  followed by a newline character. Month, day, hour and minute must be  
  zero-filled to 2 integers. For example:  
   
     "2013-07-06 17:42"  
   
  After sending the string, close the connection.
